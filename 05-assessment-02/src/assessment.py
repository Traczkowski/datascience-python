    list1 and list2 have the same length. Return a list which contains the
    maximum element of each list for every index.

def get_diagonal(mat):

    INPUT: 2 dimensional list
    OUTPUT: list

    Given a matrix encoded as a 2 dimensional python list, return a list
    containing all the values in the diagonal starting at the index 0, 0.

    E.g.
    mat = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
    | 1  2 |
    | 3  4 |
    | 5  6 |
    get_diagonal(mat) => [1, 4]

    INPUT: dictionary, dictionary
    OUTPUT: dictionary

    Return a new dictionary which contains all the keys from d1 and d2 with
    their associated values. If a key is in both dictionaries, the value should
    be the sum of the two values.

    INPUT: string

    Given a file containing rows of text, create a dictionary whose keys
    are single characters. The value associated with each key is a list of all
    the line numbers which start with that letter. The first line should have
    line number 1.  Characters which never are the first letter of a line do
    not need to be included in your dictionary.

# rental prices in the US by neighborhood. The DataFrame will have these
# columns:
# Neighborhood, City, State, med_2011, med_2014

    OUTPUT: None

    amount that the median rent increased by from 2011 to 2014.

    state. Only include these columns:
        Neighborhood, City, med_2011, med_2014

    INPUT: DataFrame
    OUTPUT: DataFrame

    Return a new pandas DataFrame which contains every city and the highest
    median rent from that city for 2011 and 2014.

    Note that city names are not unique and you need to use the state as well
    so that Portland, ME and Portland, OR are recognized as different.

    Your DataFrame should contain these columns:
        City, State, med_2011, med_2014
