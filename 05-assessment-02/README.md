# Week 2 Assessment

Welcome to the second week of the Galvanize Data Science Immersive!

* Time: 60 minutes
* Open book
* Individual

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to fill in each function stub in `assessment.py` according to its docstring and make the associated test pass. The repository structure is below for reference. `assessment.py` is under `src` directory.

There are 7 questions in `assessment.py` over these topics in this order:

* general Python (4 questions)
* pandas (3 questions)

We recommend skimming over all the questions and solving the ones that you are most confident about first.

 * **Running Unit Tests**

 * Needs **Python3 or greater**    
     * you can check your python version by running this: `python -V`

 * You can run the tests with this command from the root directory (assessment-2/):    

    `make test`

 * If you do not have py.test, you may see Import errors. Run the following command in case you see such errors:    

    `pip install pytest`     

 * `.` refers to passing test, `E` is an error in the code and `F` is a failure. So something that looks like this: `....EFFFFFF` means 4 tests passed, one has an error and 6-11 fail.
 * It can be helpful to press enter a bunch of times between each time you run the test so that it's easy to find the beginning of your most recent results.
